# General Rule: Ignore the contents of ALL service folders
# This pattern assumes that any directory containing run data/configs
# is a direct or nested subdirectory under one of your Stack folders.

# Ignore everything inside all directories recursively (/**)
# This is very broad, so we MUST follow up with exceptions.
**/*

# Exceptions (Un-ignore items we must keep)

# 1. Un-ignore all top-level Stack folders so they appear tracked
!HomeAssistantStack/
!InfrastructureStack/
!MediaStack/
!MonitoringStack/
!NetworkingStack/

# 2. Un-ignore the .gitignore file itself (essential)
!.gitignore
!.README.md

# 3. Explicitly UN-IGNORE (Keep) all YAML files
# This will re-include all .yml and .yaml files, regardless of where they are,
# even if they are inside a folder that gets ignored later.
!*.yml
!*.yaml
!*.env

# 4. Un-ignore the .gitkeep file inside EVERY tracked folder.
# This rule ensures the service folders themselves are tracked, even if empty,
# which allows the parent folders (like motioneye/) to remain tracked while their
# contents are ignored by the general **/* rule above.
!.gitkeep
